Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Lumen, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## License

The Lumen framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

# Project Architecture

## Micro Framework (Lumen)

Lumen microframework is a lightweight version of Laravel full-stack framework. Lumen use the Laravel syntax and components, and can be 'upgrade' easily to Laravel.

Lumen is a more specialized (and stripped-down) framework designed for Microservices and API development. So, some of the features in Laravel such as HTTP sessions, cookies, and templating are not needed and Lumen takes them away, keeping what's essential - routing, logging, caching, queues, validation, error handling and a couple of others.

## Graph Database (Neo4j)

### About relational database

Relational databases have been the work horse of software applications since the 80â€™s, and continue as such to this day. They store highly-structured data in tables with predetermined columns of specific types and many rows of those defined types of information. Due to the rigidity of their organization, relational databases require developers and applications to strictly structure the data used in their applications.

In relational databases, references to other rows and tables are indicated by referring to primary key attributes via foreign key columns. Joins are computed at query time by matching primary and foreign keys of all rows in the connected tables. These operations are compute-heavy and memory-intensive and have an exponential cost.

When many-to-many relationships occur in the model, you must introduce a JOIN table (or associative entity table) that holds foreign keys of both the participating tables, further increasing join operation costs.

Costly join operations are often addressed by denormalizing the data to reduce the number of joins necessary, therefore breaking the data integrity of a relational database.

### About graph database

Unlike other database management systems, relationships are of equal importance in the graph data model to the data itself. This means we are not required to infer connections between entities using special properties such as foreign keys or out-of-band processing like map-reduce.

By assembling nodes and relationships into connected structures, graph databases enable us to build simple and sophisticated models that map closely to our problem domain. The data stays remarkably similiar to the its form in the real world - small, normalized, yet richly connected entities. This allows you to query and view your data from any imaginable point of interest, supporting many different use cases.

Each node (entity or attribute) in the graph database model directly and physically contains a list of relationship records that represent the relationships to other nodes. These relationship records are organized by type and direction and may hold additional attributes. Whenever you run the equivalent of a JOIN operation, the graph database uses this list, directly accessing the connected nodes and eliminating the need for expensive search-and-match computations.

This ability to pre-materialize relationships into the database structure allows Neo4j to provide performance of several orders of magnitude above others, especially for join-heavy queries, allowing users to leverage a minutes to milliseconds advantage.

## Authentication (JWT)

Because this app uses neo4j not mysql or mongodb, so it is impossible to use the built-in auth. The built-in auth is designed to fetch something from database table.

This app will define custom auth using middleware and exception.
